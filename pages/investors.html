                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Market Reset and Focus on Fundamentals:</strong> The market is experiencing a reset with investor priorities shifting toward company fundamentals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extended Fundraising Timelines:</strong> Growth-stage funding, particularly at Series B and C stages, has become increasingly challenging, creating what has been coined the "missing middle."</li>
                    <li><strong>Europe's Leadership in Climate Tech Funding:</strong> Europe took the lead in 2024, securing $38.8 billion â€” a 45% year-over-year increase.</li>
                    <li><strong>Importance of Offtake Agreements:</strong> Offtake agreements have become increasingly important for climate tech startups, as they de-risk investments and demonstrate market interest.</li>

                <h2>Key Investor Criteria for Climate Tech Startups</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technical Expertise:</strong> At least one co-founder needs deep technical knowledge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Total Addressable Market (TAM):</strong> Your addressable market must be large enough to support venture-scale returns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unique Technology and Differentiation:</strong> Clear differentiation and defensibility are crucial.</li>
                    <li><strong>IP Protection:</strong> Patents or other strategies to protect your innovation from competitors are essential.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perfect Timing:</strong> You must articulate why now is the right moment for your solution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Go-to-Market Strategy:</strong> Investors expect both an immediate market entry plan and a long-term vision.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technology Readiness Level (TRL):</strong> Investors need to understand your risks and timeline to commercialization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traction & Early Validation:</strong> Even at pre-seed stages, investors want to see evidence of validation beyond a deck.</li>
                    <li><strong>Capital Efficiency & Unit Economics:</strong> Investors need to know you understand the capital intensity of your path and can reach meaningful milestones efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strong Fundamentals:</strong> In the current market reset, investors are further focused on companies that can deliver strong fundamentals and unit economics.</li>
